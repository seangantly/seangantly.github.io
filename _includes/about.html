                <h2>About Sean Gantly</h2>
                <p>With technology changing at an ever increasing rate, I felt my existing knowledge & experience was at risk of becoming outdated. To help combat this I chose to enrol in General Assemblyâ€™s Web Development Immersive course, an intensive full-time 3 month course which teaches students software development best practices in the latest technologies. During my time I have become proficient in the MEAN software stack & also learned additional languages & tools. My knowledge of the above can be seen by my 4 projects during my time which are available below & to view on my GitHub profile.</p>
